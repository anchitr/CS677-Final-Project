# Anchit Rao CS677 Final Project

## Instructions
To run the Jupyter Notebook file, you will require the latest version of the following libraries:
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

If you do not have them installed, you can download the code and install the Poetry dependency manager. Then follow the directions in the [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#installing-without-poetrylock) to install the libraries from the **pyproject.toml** file.

Open the notebook and click on the "Run All" button at the top.

**Note:**
All images are saved individually in the plot_images folder
